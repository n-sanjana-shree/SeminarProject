## A_Visual_Based_method_for_Teaching_the_children_using_Deep_Learning
This project aims to teach young students alphabets, words, and sentences through a visual approach by converting text into engaging images and vice versa. By combining Text-to-Image and Image-to-Text translations, it offers an interactive and immersive learning experience to enhance language acquisition in a fun and effective way.
